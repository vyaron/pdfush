Recorded user prompts
------------------------

1) "I'm adding a new feature for the app. it is the classifier page. the user drag a large PDF file - Container File (CFile). Show a loading indicator: Analying PDF… for 5 seconds. Get from a local service (hard-coded) a docs list. Split the PDF as directed by the pdfClassifierService. Name each doc by the main docType. Allow downloading a single doc." 
Note to use the word doc (and not document) throughout my code

2) "I don't use semicolons in JS"  

3) "docType for every doc should actually be an array"  

4) "sample PDF has 15 pages, every 3 pages should be separate doc"  

5) "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'drop')" (debugging prompt; fix DOM safety checks)  

6) "After classification, show collapsible section for each doc, with pages preview, and option to drag and drop entire section when collapsed and pages individually (similar to index.html)"  

7) "When dragging a page from doc1 to doc2 the display looks ok, but when downloading, both docs have 4 pages" (fix downloads to use live DOM order)  

8) "Download all docs with a single button (zip?)"  

9) "Next to the Download All as ZIP button add a button that downloads a single PDF (by the new order of pages and docs created by the user)"  

10) "Spacing: the 2 buttons are too close"  

11) "the buttons overflow the space (See attachments)"  

12) "when dragging a page to another doc, we need to update the Pages title on that section (such as: Pages 1-3 => Pages)"  

13) "On the doc list, show also the issuer info and the ESNs if exist"  

14) "please document all my previous and future prompts to the file prompts/prompts.txt"
